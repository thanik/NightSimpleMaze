NightSimpleMaze is a simple first-person maze game that the player has to collect all the items and get to the exit flag. The maze and items will be generated procedurally. The players can specify the size of the maze and how many the items are there in the maze. The game utilizes DirectX API based on DirectX Tool Kit (DirectXTK).
